				<h2> BIG DREAM </h2>
				<h4> Success. </h4>
				<p> Certain things in our lifes give us this ability to create, inspire, <b>dream</b>. I felt this when i first saw my laptop. To me, the biggest goal, I yet have to achieve is success. I see that people who wish for specific things (own Apple) will never achieve their goal. Instead, they have to aim for success, and work for it, and consider their specific objective as a part of this success and not all of it. To me, I repeat: Success is my dream. And success, is peace around family members, success is a normal life, sucess is being rich, having money, travelling, having fun: being able to help the others. This is success: this is my dream. </p>
